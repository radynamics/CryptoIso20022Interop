# DalliPay

This project enables interoperability between [ISO 20022](https://www.iso20022.org) file formats and cryptocurrency payments. It aims to facilitate sending and processing received crypto payments within existing financial software's ISO 20022 capabilities.

As a ***payer*** you can import pain.001 xml files and transform payment instructions into cryptocurrency payments. For every transaction you like to send using cryptocurrency you must define a cryptocurrency address (receiver wallet) for a given iban or proprietary account number.

As a ***payee*** you can fetch received cryptocurrency payments from your wallet and transform received payments into camt.054 xml format.

Latest releases for various platforms are available in [releases](https://github.com/radynamics/DalliPay/releases) section. Visit [www.dallipay.com](https://www.dallipay.com) for more information.

Following formats for *sending payments* are tested. Other ISO 20022 versions may also work.
- ISO 20022 pain.001.001.03
- ISO 20022 pain.001.001.09
- CSV text file (see pain.001.001.03_USD_EUR.csv in testfiles)

## Persisted data
Your private key (wallet secret) is not persisted and only used while sending payments. Configuration and settings are stored in user.home/DalliPay or %APPDATA%\DalliPay on windows.

We are ***not able to restore your password*** for persisted data. Your persisted data will be lost.  
***Never send*** us or anyone else your private key (wallet secret). Doing so will allow the receiver to transfer all your funds.
